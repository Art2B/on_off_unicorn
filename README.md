# on_off_unicorn
Web controller for DMX. Build with node and python.

# Installation
  ## Requirements
You'll need to have Python installed, I recommend Python 2.7 (tested on it), an USB DMX controller wired to some lights.

  ## How to 
1. Clone the project
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`

You can now go to localhost:3000 and trigger buttons to change light.
